# Video Dubbing and Translation Platform

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for video dubbing and translation. The platform allows users to upload videos, automatically transcribe them in Bengali, translate the content to multiple languages, and generate AI-powered dubbing. The system is built with a modern tech stack including React, Express, and PostgreSQL, with AI/ML integrations for transcription, translation, and voice synthesis.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling

### Backend Architecture
- **Server**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **File Storage**: Local file system with multer for uploads
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper error handling
- **Development**: Hot reloading with Vite integration

### Database Schema
- **Videos**: Stores video metadata, file paths, and processing status
- **Transcriptions**: Stores transcribed text segments with timestamps
- **Translations**: Stores translated text for different target languages
- **Dubbing Jobs**: Manages AI dubbing tasks and output files

## Key Components

### Video Processing Pipeline
1. **Upload**: Video files are uploaded and validated (MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV formats, max 500MB)
2. **Multi-Model Transcription**: 
   - Audio extraction using FFmpeg
   - Parallel transcription using OpenAI Whisper and Gemini 2.5 Pro
   - Automatic fallback on API quota errors
   - Combined results for higher confidence
3. **Bengali Confirmation**: Users must review and confirm Bengali transcription before proceeding
4. **Translation**: Multi-model translation using OpenAI, Google Translate, and Azure Translator
5. **Dubbing**: AI voice generation using ElevenLabs Dubbing Studio
6. **SRT Export**: Generate subtitle files in any supported language

### Storage Strategy
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for persistent data storage
- **Schema**: Videos, transcriptions, translations, and dubbing jobs with proper relationships
- **File Management**: Local file system with organized upload directories

### AI/ML Integrations
- **Multi-Model Transcription**: 
  - **OpenAI Whisper**: Primary transcription service
  - **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Secondary transcription and fallback service
  - Automatic fallback when OpenAI quota is exceeded
  - Result combination for higher confidence
- **ElevenLabs**: Voice synthesis and dubbing
- **OpenAI**: Translation services
- **Google Translate**: Additional translation validation
- **Azure Translator**: Translation confidence scoring

## Data Flow

1. **Video Upload**: User uploads video → Server validates and stores file → Processing job initiated
2. **Transcription**: Video processed → Audio extracted → Transcribed to Bengali → Segments stored
3. **Translation**: Original transcription → Multi-model translation → Confidence scoring → Best translation selected
4. **Dubbing**: Translated text → AI voice generation → Audio file created → Job completed
5. **Workspace**: User accesses transcriptions, translations, and dubbing controls in unified interface
