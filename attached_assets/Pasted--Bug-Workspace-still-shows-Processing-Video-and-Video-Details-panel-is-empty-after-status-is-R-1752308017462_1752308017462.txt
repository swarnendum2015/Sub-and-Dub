🔧 Bug: Workspace still shows “Processing Video” and Video Details panel is empty after status is “Ready”

**Context**  
- After upload and post‐processing complete, the Landing page shows the video card as “Ready.”  
- Clicking “View Workspace” navigates to `/workspace/:id`, but the header reads “Processing Video” and the Video Details table remains blank (no file size, duration, codec, etc.).

**Expected Behavior**  
1. As soon as `/api/videos/:id/status` returns `completed` (or “Ready”), the Workspace header should switch to “Ready” or “Completed.”  
2. The frontend should automatically fetch `/api/videos/:id/details` (or `/api/videos/:id/file-details`) and render the returned record in the Video Details panel.

**Steps to Fix**  
1. **Status-to-UI Sync**  
   - In the Workspace React component, add a useEffect (or TanStack Query subscription) watching the status field.  
   - When status transitions from `processing` → `completed`, update the header text accordingly.

2. **Auto-Fetch Details**  
   - After detecting `completed`, trigger a TanStack Query to fetch `/api/videos/:id/details`.  
   - Ensure the query key includes the video ID and status so it re-fetches when status changes.

3. **Backend Endpoint**  
   - Verify or implement `/api/videos/:id/details` to return the FileDetails record (size, duration, audioPath, format, codec).  
   - If no record exists, backfill from the stored metadata and return a default structure.

4. **UI Rendering**  
   - In the Video Details panel, render a loading placeholder until data arrives.  
   - If the fetch returns an empty object, display “No file details available—please retry” and log a warning.

5. **Error Logging**  
   - On details fetch failure, catch the error and send it to `/api/videos/:id/logs` with `{ step: "details-fetch", error }`.

**Deliverables**  
- React: Update Workspace component’s status watcher and details Query hook.  
- Express/Drizzle: Confirm details endpoint returns proper JSON.  
- UI: Add loading state and empty-state messaging in Video Details panel.
